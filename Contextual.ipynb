An alternative might produce less\\n      than the maximum size datagrams.  For example, one could implement\\n      a fragmentation procedure that repeatly divided large datagrams in\\n      half until the resulting fragments were less than the maximum\\n      transmission unit size.\\n    An Example Reassembly Procedure\\n      For each datagram the buffer identifier is computed as the\\n      concatenation of the source, destination, protocol, and\\n      identification fields.  If this is a whole datagram (that is both\\n      the fragment offset and the more fragments  fields are zero), then\\n      any reassembly resources associated with this buffer identifier\\n      are released and the datagram is forwarded to the next step in\\n      datagram processing.\\n      If no other fragment with this buffer identifier is on hand then\\n      reassembly resources are allocated.  The reassembly resources\\n      consist of a data buffer, a header buffer, a fragment block bit\\n      table, a total data length field, and a timer.  The data from the\\n      fragment is placed in the data buffer according to its fragment\\n      offset and length, and bits are set in the fragment block bit\\n      table corresponding to the fragment blocks received.\\n      If this is the first fragment (that is the fragment offset is\\n      zero)  this header is placed in the header buffer.  If this is the\\n      last fragment ( that is the more fragments field is zero) the\\n      total data length is computed.  If this fragment completes the\\n      datagram (tested by checking the bits set in the fragment block\\n      table), then the datagram is sent to the next step in datagram\\n      processing; otherwise the timer is set to the maximum of the\\n      current timer value and the value of the time to live field from\\n      this fragment; and the reassembly routine gives up control.\\n      If the timer runs out, the all reassembly resources for this\\n      buffer identifier are released.  The initial setting of the timer\\n      is a lower bound on the reassembly waiting time.  This is because\\n      the waiting time will be increased if the Time to Live in the\\n      arriving fragment is greater than the current timer value but will\\n      not be decreased if it is less.  The maximum this timer value\\n      could reach is the maximum time to live (approximately 4.25\\n      minutes).  The current recommendation for the initial timer\\n      setting is 15 seconds.  This may be changed as experience with\\n                                                               [Page 27]\\n')"

INTRODUCTION\\n1.1.  Motivation\\n  The Internet Protocol is designed for use in interconnected systems of\\n  packet-switched computer communication networks.  Such a system has\\n  been called a \"catenet\" [1].  The internet protocol provides for\\n  transmitting blocks of data called datagrams from sources to\\n  destinations, where sources and destinations are hosts identified by\\n  fixed length addresses.  The internet protocol also provides for\\n  fragmentation and reassembly of long datagrams, if necessary, for\\n  transmission through \"small packet\" networks.\\n1.2.  Scope\\n  The internet protocol is specifically limited in scope to provide the\\n  functions necessary to deliver a package of bits (an internet\\n  datagram) from a source to a destination over an interconnected system\\n  of networks.  There are no mechanisms to augment end-to-end data\\n  reliability, flow control, sequencing, or other services commonly\\n  found in host-to-host protocols.  The internet protocol can capitalize\\n  on the services of its supporting networks to provide various types\\n  and qualities of service.\\n1.3.  Interfaces\\n  This protocol is called on by host-to-host protocols in an internet\\n  environment.  This protocol calls on local network protocols to carry\\n  the internet datagram to the next gateway or destination host.\\n  For example, a TCP module would call on the internet module to take a\\n  TCP segment (including the TCP header and user data) as the data\\n  portion of an internet datagram.  The TCP module would provide the\\n  addresses and other parameters in the internet header to the internet\\n  module as arguments of the call.  The internet module would then\\n  create an internet datagram and call on the local network interface to\\n  transmit the internet datagram.\\n  In the ARPANET case, for example, the internet module would call on a\\n                                                                [Page 1]\\n\\n                                                          September 1981\\nInternet Protocol\\nIntroduction\\n  local net module which would add the 1822 leader [2] to the internet\\n  datagram creating an ARPANET message to transmit to the IMP.  The\\n  ARPANET address would be derived from the internet address by the\\n  local network interface and would be the address of some host in the\\n  ARPANET, that host might be a gateway to other networks.\\n1.4.  Operation\\n  The internet protocol implements two basic functions:  addressing and\\n  fragmentation.\\n  The internet modules use the addresses carried in the internet header\\n  to transmit internet datagrams toward their destinations.  The\\n  selection of a path for transmission is called routing.\\n  The internet modules use fields in the internet header to fragment and\\n  reassemble internet datagrams when necessary for transmission through\\n  \"small packet\" networks.\\n  The model of operation is that an internet module resides in each host\\n  engaged in internet communication and in each gateway that\\n  interconnects networks.  These modules share common rules for\\n  interpreting address fields and for fragmenting and assembling\\n  internet datagrams.  In addition, these modules (especially in\\n  gateways) have procedures for making routing decisions and other\\n  functions.\\n  The internet protocol treats each internet datagram as an independent\\n  entity unrelated to any other internet datagram.  There are no\\n  connections or logical circuits (virtual or otherwise).\\n  The internet protocol uses four key mechanisms in providing its\\n  service:  Type of Service, Time to Live, Options, and Header Checksum.\\n  The Type of Service is used to indicate the quality of the service\\n  desired.  The type of service is an abstract or generalized set of\\n  parameters which characterize the service choices provided in the\\n  networks that make up the internet.  This type of service indication\\n  is to be used by gateways to select the actual transmission parameters\\n  for a particular network, the network to be used for the next hop, or\\n  the next gateway when routing an internet datagram.\\n  The Time to Live is an indication of an upper bound on the lifetime of\\n  an internet datagram.  It is set by the sender of the datagram and\\n  reduced at the points along the route where it is processed.  If the\\n  time to live reaches zero before the internet datagram reaches its\\n  destination, the internet datagram is destroyed.  The time to live can\\n  be thought of as a self destruct time limit.\\n[Page 2]                                                                \\n\\nSeptember 1981                                                          \\n                                                       Internet Protocol\\n                                                            Introduction\\n  The Options provide for control functions needed or useful in some\\n  situations but unnecessary for the most common communications.  The\\n  options include provisions for timestamps, security, and special\\n  routing.\\n  The Header Checksum provides a verification that the information used\\n  in processing internet datagram has been transmitted correctly.  The\\n  data may contain errors.  If the header checksum fails, the internet\\n  datagram is discarded at once by the entity which detects the error.\\n  The internet protocol does not provide a reliable communication\\n  facility.  There are no acknowledgments either end-to-end or\\n  hop-by-hop.  There is no error control for data, only a header\\n  checksum.  There are no retransmissions.  There is no flow control.\\n  Errors detected may be reported via the Internet Control Message\\n  Protocol (ICMP) [3] which is implemented in the internet protocol\\n  module.\\n  \\n                                                                [Page 3]\\n\\n                                                          September 1981\\nInternet Protocol\\n[Page 4]                                                                \\n\\nSeptember 1981                                                          \\n                                                       Internet Protocol\\n                              2.

In this context a \"local network\" may be a small network in\\n  a building or a large network such as the ARPANET.\\n2.2.  Model of Operation\\n  The  model of operation for transmitting a datagram from one\\n  application program to another is illustrated by the following\\n  scenario:\\n    We suppose that this transmission will involve one intermediate\\n    gateway.\\n    The sending application program prepares its data and calls on its\\n    local internet module to send that data as a datagram and passes the\\n    destination address and other parameters as arguments of the call.\\n    The internet module prepares a datagram header and attaches the data\\n    to it.  The internet module determines a local network address for\\n    this internet address, in this case it is the address of a gateway.\\n                                                                [Page 5]\\n\\n                                                          September 1981\\nInternet Protocol\\nOverview\\n    It sends this datagram and the local network address to the local\\n    network interface.\\n    The local network interface creates a local network header, and\\n    attaches the datagram to it, then sends the result via the local\\n    network.\\n    The datagram arrives at a gateway host wrapped in the local network\\n    header, the local network interface strips off this header, and\\n    turns the datagram over to the internet module.  The internet module\\n    determines from the internet address that the datagram is to be\\n    forwarded to another host in a second network.

Function Description\\n  The function or purpose of Internet Protocol is to move datagrams\\n  through an interconnected set of networks.  This is done by passing\\n  the datagrams from one internet module to another until the\\n  destination is reached.  The internet modules reside in hosts and\\n  gateways in the internet system.  The datagrams are routed from one\\n  internet module to another through individual networks based on the\\n  interpretation of an internet address.  Thus, one important mechanism\\n  of the internet protocol is the internet address.\\n  In the routing of messages from one internet module to another,\\n  datagrams may need to traverse a network whose maximum packet size is\\n  smaller than the size of the datagram.  To overcome this difficulty, a\\n  fragmentation mechanism is provided in the internet protocol.\\n  Addressing\\n    A distinction is made between names, addresses, and routes [4].   A\\n    name indicates what we seek.  An address indicates where it is.  A\\n    route indicates how to get there.  The internet protocol deals\\n    primarily with addresses.  It is the task of higher level (i.e.,\\n    host-to-host or application) protocols to make the mapping from\\n    names to addresses.   The internet module maps internet addresses to\\n    local net addresses.  It is the task of lower level (i.e., local net\\n    or gateways) procedures to make the mapping from local net addresses\\n    to routes.\\n    Addresses are fixed length of four octets (32 bits).  An address\\n    begins with a network number, followed by local address (called the\\n    \"rest\" field).  There are three formats or classes of internet\\n    addresses:  in class a, the high order bit is zero, the next 7 bits\\n    are the network, and the last 24 bits are the local address; in\\n    class b, the high order two bits are one-zero, the next 14 bits are\\n    the network and the last 16 bits are the local address; in class c,\\n    the high order three bits are one-one-zero, the next 21 bits are the\\n    network and the last 8 bits are the local address.\\n    Care must be taken in mapping internet addresses to local net\\n    addresses; a single physical host must be able to act as if it were\\n    several distinct hosts to the extent of using several distinct\\n    internet addresses.  Some hosts will also have several physical\\n    interfaces (multi-homing).\\n    That is, provision must be made for a host to have several physical\\n    interfaces to the network with each having several logical internet\\n    addresses.\\n                                                                [Page 7]\\n\\n                                                          September 1981\\nInternet Protocol\\nOverview\\n    Examples of address mappings may be found in \"Address Mappings\" [5].\\n  Fragmentation\\n    Fragmentation of an internet datagram is necessary when it\\n    originates in a local net that allows a large packet size and must\\n    traverse a local net that limits packets to a smaller size to reach\\n    its destination.\\n    An internet datagram can be marked \"don’t fragment.\"  Any internet\\n    datagram so marked is not to be internet fragmented under any\\n    circumstances.  If internet datagram marked don’t fragment cannot be\\n    delivered to its destination without fragmenting it, it is to be\\n    discarded instead.\\n    Fragmentation, transmission and reassembly across a local network\\n    which is invisible to the internet protocol module is called\\n    intranet fragmentation and may be used [6].\\n    The internet fragmentation and reassembly procedure needs to be able\\n    to break a datagram into an almost arbitrary number of pieces that\\n    can be later reassembled.  The receiver of the fragments uses the\\n    identification field to ensure that fragments of different datagrams\\n    are not mixed.  The fragment offset field tells the receiver the\\n    position of a fragment in the original datagram.  The fragment\\n    offset and length determine the portion of the original datagram\\n    covered by this fragment.  The more-fragments flag indicates (by\\n    being reset) the last fragment.  These fields provide sufficient\\n    information to reassemble datagrams.\\n    The identification field is used to distinguish the fragments of one\\n    datagram from those of another.  The originating protocol module of\\n    an internet datagram sets the identification field to a value that\\n    must be unique for that source-destination pair and protocol for the\\n    time the datagram will be active in the internet system.  The\\n    originating protocol module of a complete datagram sets the\\n    more-fragments flag to zero and the fragment offset to zero.\\n    To fragment a long internet datagram, an internet protocol module\\n    (for example, in a gateway), creates two new internet datagrams and\\n    copies the contents of the internet header fields from the long\\n    datagram into both new internet headers.  The data of the long\\n    datagram is divided into two portions on a 8 octet (64 bit) boundary\\n    (the second portion might not be an integral multiple of 8 octets,\\n    but the first must be).  Call the number of 8 octet blocks in the\\n    first portion NFB (for Number of Fragment Blocks).  The first\\n    portion of the data is placed in the first new internet datagram,\\n    and the total length field is set to the length of the first\\n[Page 8] \\n\\nSeptember 1981 \\n                                                       Internet Protocol\\n                                                                Overview\\n    datagram.  The more-fragments flag is set to one.  The second\\n    portion of the data is placed in the second new internet datagram,\\n    and the total length field is set to the length of the second\\n    datagram.  The more-fragments flag carries the same value as the\\n    long datagram.  The fragment offset field of the second new internet\\n    datagram is set to the value of that field in the long datagram plus\\n    NFB.\\n    This procedure can be generalized for an n-way split, rather than\\n    the two-way split described.\\n    To assemble the fragments of an internet datagram, an internet\\n    protocol module (for example at a destination host) combines\\n    internet datagrams that all have the same value for the four fields:\\n    identification, source, destination, and protocol.  The combination\\n    is done by placing the data portion of each fragment in the relative\\n    position indicated by the fragment offset in that fragment’s\\n    internet header.  The first fragment will have the fragment offset\\n    zero, and the last fragment will have the more-fragments flag reset\\n    to zero.\\n2.4.  Gateways\\n  Gateways implement internet protocol to forward datagrams between\\n  networks.  Gateways also implement the Gateway to Gateway Protocol\\n  (GGP) [7] to coordinate routing and other internet control\\n  information.\\n  In a gateway the higher level protocols need not be implemented and\\n  the GGP functions are added to the IP module.\\n                                    \\n                   +-------------------------------+   \\n                   | Internet Protocol & ICMP & GGP|   \\n                   +-------------------------------+   \\n                           |                 |         \\n                 +---------------+   +---------------+ \\n                 |   Local Net   |   |   Local Net   | \\n                 +---------------+   +---------------+ \\n                           Gateway Protocols\\n                               Figure 3.\\n  \\n                                                                [Page 9]\\n\\n                                                          September 1981\\nInternet Protocol\\n[Page 10]                                                               \\n\\nSeptember 1981                                                          \\n                                                       Internet Protocol\\n                           3.

This field allows the length of\\n    a datagram to be up to 65,535 octets.  Such long datagrams are\\n    impractical for most hosts and networks.

For\\n    example, this size allows a data block of 512 octets plus 64 header\\n    octets to fit in a datagram.

The time is measured in units of\\n    seconds, but since every module that processes a datagram must\\n    decrease the TTL by at least one even if it process the datagram in\\n    less than a second, the TTL must be thought of only as an upper\\n    bound on the time a datagram may exist.

While the goal of this specification is to be explicit\\n  about the protocol there is the possibility of differing\\n  interpretations.  In general, an implementation must be conservative\\n  in its sending behavior, and liberal in its receiving behavior.  That\\n  is, it must be careful to send well-formed datagrams, but must accept\\n  any datagram that it can interpret (e.g., not object to technical\\n  errors where the meaning is still clear).\\n  The basic internet service is datagram oriented and provides for the\\n  fragmentation of datagrams at gateways, with reassembly taking place\\n  at the destination internet protocol module in the destination host.\\n  Of course, fragmentation and reassembly of datagrams within a network\\n  or by private agreement between the gateways of a network is also\\n  allowed since this is transparent to the internet protocols and the\\n  higher-level protocols.  This transparent type of fragmentation and\\n  reassembly is termed \"network-dependent\" (or intranet) fragmentation\\n  and is not discussed further here.\\n  Internet addresses distinguish sources and destinations to the host\\n  level and provide a protocol field as well.

An alternative might produce less\\n      than the maximum size datagrams.  For example, one could implement\\n      a fragmentation procedure that repeatly divided large datagrams in\\n      half until the resulting fragments were less than the maximum\\n      transmission unit size.\\n    An Example Reassembly Procedure\\n      For each datagram the buffer identifier is computed as the\\n      concatenation of the source, destination, protocol, and\\n      identification fields.  If this is a whole datagram (that is both\\n      the fragment offset and the more fragments  fields are zero), then\\n      any reassembly resources associated with this buffer identifier\\n      are released and the datagram is forwarded to the next step in\\n      datagram processing.\\n      If no other fragment with this buffer identifier is on hand then\\n      reassembly resources are allocated.  The reassembly resources\\n      consist of a data buffer, a header buffer, a fragment block bit\\n      table, a total data length field, and a timer.  The data from the\\n      fragment is placed in the data buffer according to its fragment\\n      offset and length, and bits are set in the fragment block bit\\n      table corresponding to the fragment blocks received.\\n      If this is the first fragment (that is the fragment offset is\\n      zero)  this header is placed in the header buffer.  If this is the\\n      last fragment ( that is the more fragments field is zero) the\\n      total data length is computed.  If this fragment completes the\\n      datagram (tested by checking the bits set in the fragment block\\n      table), then the datagram is sent to the next step in datagram\\n      processing; otherwise the timer is set to the maximum of the\\n      current timer value and the value of the time to live field from\\n      this fragment; and the reassembly routine gives up control.\\n      If the timer runs out, the all reassembly resources for this\\n      buffer identifier are released.  The initial setting of the timer\\n      is a lower bound on the reassembly waiting time.  This is because\\n      the waiting time will be increased if the Time to Live in the\\n      arriving fragment is greater than the current timer value but will\\n      not be decreased if it is less.  The maximum this timer value\\n      could reach is the maximum time to live (approximately 4.25\\n      minutes).  The current recommendation for the initial timer\\n      setting is 15 seconds.  This may be changed as experience with\\n                                                               [Page 27]\\n\\n                                                          September 1981\\nInternet Protocol\\nSpecification\\n      this protocol accumulates.

The protocol module assembling fragments judges fragments\\n    to belong to the same datagram if they have the same source,\\n    destination, protocol, and Identifier.  Thus, the sender must choose\\n    the Identifier to be unique for this source, destination pair and\\n    protocol for the time the datagram (or any fragment of it) could be\\n    alive in the internet.\\n    It seems then that a sending protocol module needs to keep a table\\n    of Identifiers, one entry for each destination it has communicated\\n    with in the last maximum packet lifetime for the internet.\\n    However, since the Identifier field allows 65,536 different values,\\n    some host may be able to simply use unique identifiers independent\\n    of destination.\\n    It is appropriate for some higher level protocols to choose the\\n    identifier. For example, TCP protocol modules may retransmit an\\n    identical TCP segment, and the probability for correct reception\\n    would be enhanced if the retransmission carried the same identifier\\n    as the original transmission since fragments of either datagram\\n    could be used to construct a correct TCP segment.\\n  Type of Service\\n    The type of service (TOS) is for internet service quality selection.\\n    The type of service is specified along the abstract parameters\\n    precedence, delay, throughput, and reliability.  These abstract\\n    parameters are to be mapped into the actual service parameters of\\n    the particular networks the datagram traverses.\\n    Precedence.

A higher level of effort to ensure delivery is\\n    important for datagrams with this indication.\\n    For example, the ARPANET has a priority bit, and a choice between\\n    \"standard\" messages (type 0) and \"uncontrolled\" messages (type 3),\\n    (the choice between single packet and multipacket messages can also\\n    be considered a service parameter). The uncontrolled messages tend\\n    to be less reliably delivered and suffer less delay.  Suppose an\\n    internet datagram is to be sent through the ARPANET.  Let the\\n    internet type of service be given as:\\n      Precedence:    5\\n      Delay:         0\\n      Throughput:    1\\n      Reliability:   1\\n    In this example, the mapping of these parameters to those available\\n    for the ARPANET would be  to set the ARPANET priority bit on since\\n    the Internet precedence is in the upper half of its range, to select\\n    standard messages since the throughput and reliability requirements\\n    are indicated and delay is not.  More details are given on service\\n    mappings in \"Service Mappings\" [8].\\n  Time to Live\\n    The time to live is set by the sender to the maximum time the\\n    datagram is allowed to be in the internet system.  If the datagram\\n    is in the internet system longer than the time to live, then the\\n    datagram must be destroyed.\\n    This field must be decreased at each point that the internet header\\n    is processed to reflect the time spent processing the datagram.\\n    Even if no local information is available on the time actually\\n    spent, the field must be decremented by 1.  The time is measured in\\n    units of seconds (i.e. the value 1 means one second).  Thus, the\\n    maximum time to live is 255 seconds or 4.25 minutes.  Since every\\n    module that processes a datagram must decrease the TTL by at least\\n    one even if it process the datagram in less than a second, the TTL\\n    must be thought of only as an upper bound on the time a datagram may\\n    exist.  The intention is to cause undeliverable datagrams to be\\n    discarded, and to bound the maximum datagram lifetime.\\n    Some higher level reliable connection protocols are based on\\n    assumptions that old duplicate datagrams will not arrive after a\\n    certain time elapses.  The TTL is a way for such protocols to have\\n    an assurance that their assumption is met.\\n[Page 30]                                                               \\n\\nSeptember 1981                                                          \\n                                                       Internet Protocol\\n                                                           Specification\\n  Options\\n    The options are optional in each datagram, but required in\\n    implementations.  That is, the presence or absence of an option is\\n    the choice of the sender, but each internet module must be able to\\n    parse every option.  There can be several options present in the\\n    option field.\\n    The options might not end on a 32-bit boundary.  The internet header\\n    must be filled out with octets of zeros.  The first of these would\\n    be interpreted as the end-of-options option, and the remainder as\\n    internet header padding.\\n    Every internet module must be able to act on every option.  The\\n    Security Option is required if classified, restricted, or\\n    compartmented traffic is to be passed.\\n  Checksum\\n    The internet header checksum is recomputed if the internet header is\\n    changed.  For example, a reduction of the time to live, additions or\\n    changes to internet options, or due to fragmentation.  This checksum\\n    at the internet level is intended to protect the internet header\\n    fields from transmission errors.\\n    There are some applications where a few data bit errors are\\n    acceptable while retransmission delays are not.  If the internet\\n    protocol enforced data correctness such applications could not be\\n    supported.\\n  Errors\\n    Internet protocol errors may be reported via the ICMP messages [3].\\n3.3.

Since internet protocol is a datagram\\n  protocol, there is minimal memory or state maintained between datagram\\n  transmissions, and each call on the internet protocol module by the\\n  user supplies all information necessary for the IP to perform the\\n  service requested.\\n  An Example Upper Level Interface\\n  The following two example calls satisfy the requirements for the user\\n  to internet protocol module communication (\"=>\" means returns):\\n  SEND (src, dst, prot, TOS, TTL, BufPTR, len, Id, DF, opt => result)\\n    where:\\n      src = source address\\n      dst = destination address\\n      prot = protocol\\n      TOS = type of service\\n      TTL = time to live\\n      BufPTR = buffer pointer\\n      len = length of buffer\\n      Id  = Identifier\\n      DF = Don’t Fragment\\n      opt = option data\\n      result = response\\n        OK = datagram sent ok\\n        Error = error in arguments or local network error\\n    Note that the precedence is included in the TOS and the\\n    security/compartment is passed as an option.\\n  RECV (BufPTR, prot, => result, src, dst, TOS, len, opt)\\n    where:\\n      BufPTR = buffer pointer\\n      prot = protocol\\n      result = response\\n        OK = datagram received ok\\n        Error = error in arguments\\n      len = length of buffer\\n      src = source address\\n      dst = destination address\\n      TOS = type of service\\n      opt = option data\\n[Page 32]                                                               \\n\\nSeptember 1981                                                          \\n                                                       Internet Protocol\\n                                                           Specification\\n  When the user sends a datagram, it executes the SEND call supplying\\n  all the arguments.  The internet protocol module, on receiving this\\n  call, checks the arguments and prepares and sends the message.  If the\\n  arguments are good and the datagram is accepted by the local network,\\n  the call returns successfully.  If either the arguments are bad, or\\n  the datagram is not accepted by the local network, the call returns\\n  unsuccessfully.  On unsuccessful returns, a reasonable report must be\\n  made as to the cause of the problem, but the details of such reports\\n  are up to individual implementations.\\n  When a datagram arrives at the internet protocol module from the local\\n  network, either there is a pending RECV call from the user addressed\\n  or there is not.  In the first case, the pending call is satisfied by\\n  passing the information from the datagram to the user.  In the second\\n  case, the user addressed is notified of a pending datagram.  If the\\n  user addressed does not exist, an ICMP error message is returned to\\n  the sender, and the data is discarded.\\n  The notification of a user may be via a pseudo interrupt or similar\\n  mechanism, as appropriate in the particular operating system\\n  environment of the implementation.\\n  A user’s RECV call may then either be immediately satisfied by a\\n  pending datagram, or the call may be pending until a datagram arrives.\\n  The source address is included in the send call in case the sending\\n  host has several addresses (multiple physical connections or logical\\n  addresses).  The internet module must check to see that the source\\n  address is one of the legal address for this host.\\n  An implementation may also allow or require a call to the internet\\n  module to indicate interest in or reserve exclusive use of a class of\\n  datagrams (e.g., all those with a certain value in the protocol\\n  field).\\n  This section functionally characterizes a USER/IP interface.  The\\n  notation used is similar to most procedure of function calls in high\\n  level languages, but this usage is not meant to rule out trap type\\n  service calls (e.g., SVCs, UUOs, EMTs), or any other form of\\n  interprocess communication.\\n  \\n                                                               [Page 33]\\n\\n                                                          September 1981\\nInternet Protocol\\nAPPENDIX A:  Examples & Scenarios\\nExample 1:\\n  This is an example of the minimal data carrying internet datagram:\\n                                    \\n    0                   1                   2                   3   \\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 \\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\\n   |Ver= 4 |IHL= 5 |Type of Service|        Total Length = 21      |\\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\\n   |      Identification = 111     |Flg=0|   Fragment Offset = 0   |\\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\\n   |   Time = 123  |  Protocol = 1 |        header checksum        |\\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\\n   |                         source address                        |\\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\\n   |                      destination address                      |\\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\\n   |     data      |                                                \\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                                                \\n                       Example Internet Datagram\\n                               Figure 5.\\n  Note that each tick mark represents one bit position.\\n  This is a internet datagram in version 4 of internet protocol; the\\n  internet header consists of five 32 bit words, and the total length of\\n  the datagram is 21 octets.

For example, in the following\\ndiagram the octets are transmitted in the order they are numbered.\\n                                    \\n    0                   1                   2                   3   \\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 \\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\\n   |       1       |       2       |       3       |       4       |\\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\\n   |       5       |       6       |       7       |       8       |\\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\\n   |       9       |      10       |      11       |      12       |\\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\\n                      Transmission Order of Bytes\\n                               Figure 10.\\nWhenever an octet represents a numeric quantity the left most bit in the\\ndiagram is the high order or most significant bit.  That is, the bit\\nlabeled 0 is the most significant bit.  For example, the following\\ndiagram represents the value 170 (decimal).\\n                                    \\n                            0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \\n                           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\\n                           |1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0|\\n                           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\\n                          Significance of Bits\\n                               Figure 11.\\nSimilarly, whenever a multi-octet field represents a numeric quantity\\nthe left most bit of the whole field is the most significant bit.  When\\na multi-octet quantity is transmitted the most significant octet is\\ntransmitted first.\\n                                                               [Page 39]\\n\\n                                                          September 1981\\nInternet Protocol\\n[Page 40]                                                               \\n\\nSeptember 1981                                                          \\n                                                       Internet Protocol\\n                                GLOSSARY\\n1822\\n          BBN Report 1822, \"The Specification of the Interconnection of\\n          a Host and an IMP\".

It was developed by the Information Sciences Institute at the University of Southern California for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), specifically the Information Processing Techniques Office located at 1400 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, Virginia. This document, known as RFC 791, was a revision based on six earlier editions of the ARPA Internet Protocol Specification and included revisions regarding aspects such as addressing, error handling, option codes, and features related to security and handling restrictions. This protocol is a pillar in the suite of standards for network communication, defining the mechanisms for transmitting data packets called datagrams across network boundaries while ensuring address interpretation, fragmentation, and routing within interconnected systems known as \\'catenets.\\' RFC 791 also specifies the interfaces, operation models, and functional descriptions necessary for protocol implementation and interoperability, providing the foundation for higher-level protocols like TCP and UDP.'}},\n",

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Information Processing Techniques Office is situated at 1400 Wilson Boulevard in Arlington, Virginia, reflecting its sponsorship role in supporting the development of the TCP/IP protocol suite under the DARPA Internet Program. This program provided the foundation for the modern Internet. The chunk also references the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) at the University of Southern California, located at 4676 Admiralty Way, Marina del Rey, California. ISI played a crucial role in the development and drafting of essential Internet protocols, including the Internet Protocol outlined in this document. The document emphasizes efforts from ISI, under the editorial leadership of Jon Postel, to standardize the protocol for interconnected systems and packet-switched networks, thus laying groundwork for Internet communication. These addresses mark the collaborative and geographically diverse nature of early Internet research and development efforts.'}},\n",

INTRODUCTION ..................................................... 1\\n  1.1  Motivation .................................................... 1\\n  1.2  Scope ......................................................... 1The Internet Protocol, as described in RFC 791, is a crucial component of computer communication within packet-switched networks. The document, prepared by the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), outlines the specifications and functionalities of the protocol as of September 1981. The document revises earlier versions, addressing key areas such as addressing, error handling, and security features, and introduces the concept of fragmentation and reassembly of datagrams for transmission through networks with varying packet sizes. It emphasizes the modular relationship between the internet protocol and other protocols at various levels in the networking hierarchy, like TCP and UDP, demonstrating its role as the backbone for data transmission across interconnected systems. The specification provides foundational guidelines to ensure data is correctly transmitted between networks, with a focus on addressing methods, error-checking mechanisms, and procedural details vital for developers and engineers engaged in network architecture and design.\"}},\n",

OVERVIEW ......................................................... 5\\n  2.1  Relation to Other Protocols ................................... 9\\n  2.2  Model of Operation ............................................ 5\\n  2.3  Function Description .......................................... 7The document being referenced is the RFC 791, which specifies the DoD Standard Internet Protocol. The table of contents outlines the key sections of the document, starting with the introduction which includes sub-sections on motivation, scope, interfaces, and operation of the Internet Protocol. The scope of the protocol is specifically limited to the functions necessary for delivering an internet datagram from a source to a destination over interconnected networks, and it does not include mechanisms for end-to-end data reliability or flow control, leaving these aspects to higher-level protocols. The interfaces section describes how the protocol interacts with host-to-host protocols and local network protocols, exemplifying the interaction through TCP and the role of local networks like the ARPANET in the transmission process. The operation section elaborates on the core functions of addressing and fragmentation, detailing how internet modules use addresses for routing datagrams, and how they fragment and reassemble datagrams when necessary. Following the introduction, the document provides an overview that relates the Internet Protocol to other protocols through a hierarchical diagram and explains its model of operation involving the transmission of datagrams across a hypothetical connected network with gateways. The function description within the overview section discusses the fundamental purpose of the protocol in moving datagrams through interconnected networks using addressing and fragmentation mechanisms.'}},\n",

The primary role of IP is to facilitate routing of data packets, called datagrams, between source and destination hosts across interconnected networks. The document makes a distinction between names, addresses, and routes, emphasizing that IP mainly handles addresses, specifically formatted in a hierarchical structure of network and local (host) parts. IP also includes mechanisms for fragmentation, allowing large datagrams to be split into smaller pieces to fit the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of a given network, ensuring they are reassembled correctly at the destination. \\n\\nSection 2.4, titled \"Gateways,\" delves into the function of gateways in the network. Gateways are critical devices that interconnect networks, implementing IP to forward datagrams appropriately. They also utilize the Gateway to Gateway Protocol (GGP) to share necessary routing information and manage datagram forwarding. Gateways do not necessarily need to support higher-level protocols but must manage the addition of GGP functionalities to the IP module, learning routing paths, and making forwarding decisions for datagrams.\\n\\nThe subsequent sections detailed in the table of contents - Section 3 on \"Specification,\" encompassing topics like Internet Header Format (3.1), a Discussion (3.2), and Interfaces (3.3) - delve into the technical specifics of the IP headers, protocols, and how different interfaces operate within the network system. These sections are designed to provide exhaustive technical details on the implementation and functionality of IP.\\n\\nAPPENDIX A offers practical insights with examples and scenarios on the application of the IP specifications, helping implementers understand the practical nuances of IP traffic, fragmentation, and reconstruction of datagrams, ensuring a robust and clear understanding of the technical material provided in previous sections of the document.'}},\n",

It was published in September 1981. \\n\\nThis RFC outlines the DoD Standard Internet Protocol based on earlier editions of the ARPA Internet Protocol Specification. It emphasizes revisions made in addressing, error handling, option codes, and features like security, precedence, compartments, and handling restrictions.\\n\\nIn the introduction, the document explains the motivation, scope, interfaces, and operation of the Internet Protocol. The protocol is designed for use in interconnected systems called \"catenet,\" which are packet-switched computer communication networks. Its primary function is to deliver internet datagrams from a source to a destination over interconnected networks. It is noted that the protocol itself does not provide enhancements common in host-to-host protocols, such as end-to-end data reliability, flow control, or sequencing. The document includes details about interfaces where the protocol is called on by host-to-host protocols in an internet environment, and it subsequently calls on local network protocols to transmit the datagram further. \\n\\nThe document also details the operation of the internet module present in each host and gateway, which handles addressing and fragmentation to route to the correct destination. It supports packet fragmentation when required by small-packet networks, provides a type of service indication to define the desired quality of service, sets a time-to-live to limit datagram lifetime, supports several options for specific needs, and checks header integrity with checksums.\\n\\nIn the appendix sections, the document provides examples and scenarios of internet datagram and fragment structures to illustrate the practical application of the internet protocol. Also included is the data transmission order, which explains how data is transmitted at the octet level. Lastly, the glossary provides definitions of various terms and concepts used throughout the document, ensuring that readers understand specific language and technical terms.'}},\n",

This specification, prepared by the Information Sciences Institute at the University of Southern California, laid out the foundational concepts for data transmission over interconnected networks, widely known as the internet. The document was provided by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Information Processing Techniques Office and served as a guideline for implementing network communication standards, with significant revisions from its preceding versions in areas such as addressing, error handling, and security features. This edition replaces RFC 760 and incorporates insights from various earlier ARPA Internet Protocol Specifications, offering a comprehensive protocol framework still referenced in modern digital communication.\"}},\n",

This\\ndocument is based on six earlier editions of the ARPA Internet Protocol\\nSpecification, and the present text draws heavily from them.  There have\\nbeen many contributors to this work both in terms of concepts and interms of text. This revision updates key aspects such as addressing, error handling, option codes, and incorporates features related to security, precedence, compartments, and handling restrictions of the internet protocol. The document outlines the internet protocol, which is pivotal in transferring data packets known as datagrams across multiple networks, collectively forming a \"catenet\". As technology evolves, maintaining efficient communication between different network systems becomes imperative, and this document serves as a foundational guide toward achieving that seamless integration. The convergence of various conceptual contributions has significantly enhanced the protocol\\'s current specification, ensuring it remains pertinent in addressing contemporary networking challenges.'}},\n",

INTRODUCTION\\n1.1.  Motivation\\n  The Internet Protocol is designed for use in interconnected systems of\\n  packet-switched computer communication networks.  Such a system hasAs part of the DARPA Internet Program, the Internet Protocol (IP) outlined in RFC 791, published in September 1981, aims to establish a standardized method for transmitting data across interconnected networks, commonly referred to as a \"catenet.\" The document, which supersedes RFC 760 and various Internet Experiment Notes (IENs) such as IEN 128, 123, 111, 80, 54, 44, 41, 28, and 26, specifically focuses on enabling the communication between hosts in diverse networking environments by transmitting datagrams. Notably, the Internet Protocol provides essential services like addressing and fragmentation necessary to send data efficiently across such systems, yet it doesn\\'t include mechanisms for ensuring end-to-end data reliability or flow control. Instead, it relies on supplementary protocols for these functions. Furthermore, the specification addresses the complex routing challenges and tasks involved in directing datagrams from source to destination through multiple interconnected networks.'}}]"
